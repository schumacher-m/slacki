# slacki
Slack in your terminal (read-only)

*My Use-Case:* Have a way to __not__ leave your terminal but still be able to read slack (and have a reason to learn rust)

## Setup

Install Rust via ```curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh```

## Get Slack API Token

Goto https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens

## Run

```
cargo run {YOUR_API_KEY}
```
